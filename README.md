# Improving Multi-Label Classification with Graph Neural Networks

>   Multi-label image classification is a wide-spread problematic that aims at predicting which objects are present in an image. 
Later improvements correlate with the improvements in single-label image classification, 
but such methods omit to capture the relationships between objects. 
It appears that some objects are more likely to be found together, 
therefore graphs of relationships between labels can be leveraged to improve the usual classification pipeline. 
Therefore, we review three graph neural networks based methods that use this knowledge to improve the performances of the models.
